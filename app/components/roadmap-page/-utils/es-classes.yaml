  summary: |
    Use native class syntax interchangeably with the Ember Object model.
  description: |
    Native ES classes are advancing quickly, with features like [class
    fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields),
    private [fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#private-fields)
    and [methods](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-methods),
    and [decorators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) just around the
    corner. At the same time, more and more tooling is being developed for the
    syntax, from developer tools and editors to documentation generators and
    more. Ember has always been about shared solutions, and transitioning to the
    modern native class syntax is no exception!

    As it turns out, the existing object model is already highly cross-compatible
    with the new class syntax. The [ES Class
    RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0240-es-classes.md)
    outlined a path forward that required few changes to the existing object model,
    mostly around fixing broken features such as observers and event listeners,
    and allowing "zebra-striping" - being able to go back and forth between native
    classes and EmberObject based classes using the old style.

    The RFC also touched on decorators, but didn't specify any to be added to Ember
    directly yet. Instead, it encouraged continued exploration by addons such as
    the long running [ember-decorators](https://github.com/ember-decorators)
    project, which has been experimenting with decorators since they were first
    proposed and is continuing to evolve their syntax and usage. Over time addons
    like these will be the basis for a set of decorators in Ember, similar to how
    [ember-native-dom-helpers paved the way for modern testing helpers](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0268-acceptance-testing-refactor.md#dom-interaction-helpers).

    A [quest
    issue](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/16927) is actively used
    by the strike team `#st-native-classes` to keep track of all of the major tasks left.
