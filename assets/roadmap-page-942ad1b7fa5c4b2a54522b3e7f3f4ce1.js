You can then fetch additional bundles either in the\nbackground when the user is idle, or in response to a user-initiated\naction.\n\nAn application\'s routes are the most common boundary used to decide where\nto split code. Because of Ember\'s strong conventions around both routing\nand file system layout, and early adoption of JavaScript (ES6) modules, we\nshould make it easy for developers to get route-based code splitting "for\nfree" with Ember CLI.\n\nIf a developer wants to code split more aggressively (i.e. _within_ a route\nin addition to between routes), at minimum that capability should be\navailable via an addon.\n\nThe advantage of code splitting is that load time is tied to the\ncomplexity of a particular task or page, not the complexity of the entire\napp. Currently, when adding code to an app, every user pays some cost for\nthat code even if they never visit the page that uses it.\n\nThe most popular code splitting tool in the ecosystem today is webpack,\nalthough Closure Compiler has had similar functionality for years.\nWhichever tool we use by default, we want to design the route-based code\nsplitting feature to be pluggable so it can be implemented with any tool.\nNot only does this give us portability in case a new tool gains\npopularity, it means that addon authors can experiment with new packaging\nand bundling strategies.\n\nThe [Strategies RFC](https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/110) proposes an\nextension to Ember CLI to add a packaging hook to the build pipeline.\nThis hook would allow any addon to see the entire application in its final,\nassembled form but before concatenation or compilation of JavaScript modules\ninto AMD.\n\nIn keeping with our goal of ["unlocked\nexperimentation"](https://emberjs.com/blog/2017/04/05/emberconf-2017-state-of-the-union.html#toc_our-new-modus-operandi-unlocked-experimentation-in-place-upgrades),\nwe are starting with this extension point to allow the community to build\naddons that can easily integrate with code splitting tools like webpack.\n\nOnce the extension point exists and we can experiment with different\napproaches, the next step will be to evaluate when and how this might\nbecome part of the default out-of-the-box Ember experience.\n',status:"under-consideration",statusText:"RFC Submitted",availability:"Not yet available.",resources:[{type:"rfc",name:"Packaging Strategies RFC",url:"https://github.com/ember-cli/rfcs/pull/110"}],champions:[{name:"Robert Jackson",image:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/12637?v=4&s=460",url:"https://github.com/rwjblue"},{name:"Tom Dale",image:"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/90888?v=4&s=460",url:"https://github.com/tomdale"}]}]}),define("roadmap-page/components/roadmap-page/-utils/engines",["exports"],function(e){Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0}),e.default=void 0

Developers who wanted to\nexperiment with creating an optimized version without the full set of\nfeatures were stuck.\n\nWith the router service, it's possible to write a custom component that\ntransitions the application's router to a new URL:\n\n```js\nimport Component from '@ember/component';\nimport { inject } from '@ember/service';\n\nexport default Component.extend({\n  router: inject(),\n  url: '/home',\n  click() {\n    let url = this.get('url');\n    this.get('router').transitionTo(url);\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe [Router Service\nRFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0095-router-service.md)\nhas been accepted and implementation has begun.
